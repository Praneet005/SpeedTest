The Typing Test Project is a comprehensive and interactive application designed to assess and improve individuals' typing skills. 
In an era where effective communication and digital literacy are crucial, the ability to type quickly and accurately is a valuable asset. 
The project aims to provide users with a platform to gauge their typing speed, accuracy, and overall proficiency while offering tools to enhance their typing abilities.

The Typing Test Project aims to address the limitations and challenges posed by the existing manual and traditional methods of assessing typing speed and accuracy. 

By comparing the proposed project with the existing system, we can identify the key problem statements:
Subjective Evaluation vs. Objective Measurement.
Lack of Real-time Feedback and Improvement.
Limited Customization and Interactivity.
Lack of Performance Visualization and Motivation.

The Typing Test Project seeks to overcome these challenges by providing an automated, interactive, and personalized typing assessment and improvement platform. 
By addressing the limitations of the existing system, the project aims to offer users a more efficient, effective, and 
engaging means of developing their typing skills while receiving objective feedback and performance metrics.
